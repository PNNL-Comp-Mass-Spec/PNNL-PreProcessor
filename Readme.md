Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) provides an increasingly popular platform for analyzing complex samples due to its separation power and ability to differentiate structural isomers, which are difficult to resolve using conventional LC-MS systems. Here we provide a software tool with various algorithms and utilities to improve workflows using this technology: data compression and interpolation, ion mobility demultiplexing, multidimensional smoothing, noise filtering by low intensity threshold and spike removal, saturation repair and metadata export.
